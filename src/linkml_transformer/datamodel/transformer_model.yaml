title: LinkML Data Transformer Model
description: |-
  Datamodel for LinkML schema transformations.
  
  A transformer generates instances of a *target* data model from
  instances of a *source* data model. This transformation process
  is guided by a *TransformationSpecification*.
  
  The specification is independent of any one method for transforming
  data. It allows different approaches, including:
  
  - direct implementation, transforming python or json objects
  - translation of the specification into SQL commands, to operate on relations
  - translation of the specification into SPARQL CONSTRUCTs, to operate on triples
  - translation into another specification language, such as R2RML

        description: >-
          Used to specify a class-slot tuple that is the inverse of the derived/target slot.
          This is used primarily for mapping to relational databases or formalisms that do
          not allow multiple values. The class representing the repeated element has a foreign
          key slot inserted in that 'back references' the original multivalued slot.
