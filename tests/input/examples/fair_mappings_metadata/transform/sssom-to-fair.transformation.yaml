title: SSSOM to FAIR Mappings Schema Transformation
description: |-
  Transforms an SSSOM Mapping Set to a FAIR Mappings Schema MappingSpecification.
  This preserves metadata elements while discarding the individual mappings,
  which have no equivalent in the FAIR Mappings Schema (which focuses on
  mapping specification metadata, not individual mapping assertions).

  Key transformations:
  - mapping_set_id → id
  - mapping_set_title → name
  - mapping_set_description → description
  - subject_source → subject_source.id
  - object_source → object_source.id
  - Sets type to 'sssom' to indicate the mapping specification type

  Note: Creator/author/reviewer transformations are simplified since SSSOM
  uses flat ID lists while FAIR Mappings uses structured Agent objects.

      Maps SSSOM Mapping Set metadata to MappingSpecification.
      Note: Individual mappings are not preserved as they represent
      actual mapping assertions, not metadata about the specification.
