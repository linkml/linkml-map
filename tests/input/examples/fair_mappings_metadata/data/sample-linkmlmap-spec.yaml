# Sample TransformationSpecification instance for testing transformation to FAIR Mappings Schema
# This example includes both metadata AND actual transformation content.
# When transformed to FAIR Mappings Schema, only the metadata elements are extracted;
# the class_derivations, enum_derivations etc. are linkml-map specific and not part of FAIR Mappings.
#
# NOTE: class_derivations and enum_derivations are commented out below due to a bug
# in dynamic_object.py that doesn't handle key-based (vs identifier-based) classes.
# The actual transformation would ignore these anyway since FAIR Mappings Schema
# doesn't have equivalents for these linkml-map specific elements.

title: Gene Expression Data Transformation
description: |-
  A transformation specification that maps gene expression data from
  a legacy format to a standardized biomedical data model.

  This specification includes class derivations for:
  - GeneExpressionMixin (from GeneExpressionRecord)
  - OrganismTaxon (from SampleMetadata)
  - Study (from ExperimentInfo)

  And enum derivations for:
  - ExpressionLevelCategory (from LegacyExpressionLevel)
